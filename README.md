FoxReplace Silliness
====================

Some fun/silly sets of substitutions to import into the [FoxReplace](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxreplace/) addon for Firefox.

Usage
-----

In the FoxReplace options, click Import from URL. Enter https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DAVe3283/FoxReplace-Silliness/master/FoxReplace.json and click OK.

Or, if you feel lucky, enable the "periodically update from URL" option, pointing it at the above URL.

Finally, you can download the JSON file(s) directly, and grab what you want.
